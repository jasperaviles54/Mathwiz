            <p class="p-1">Two angles are co-terminal if they are drawn in the standard position and both have their terminal sides in the same location.</p>
            <p class="p-1">What angle measurements would result in the same initial and terminal side position as a 0 degree angle? Imagine if you spin the terminal side counterclockwise once all the way around the circle until both sides of the angle point toward the 3 again. The final result looks the same as the 0 degree angle. However, the blue side was rotated through 360 degrees. Therefore, 360 degrees is a coterminal angle to 0 degrees. The only difference in the measures is indicated by the rotation arrow.</p>
            <img src="../Pictures/360.gif" alt="360">
            <p class="p-1"><b>Fun Fact:</b> Coterminal angles are angles that begin and end in the same place as each other. So when one skateboarder does a 360 spin and another skateboarder does a 720 spin these two angles are coterminal. And if you didn't see the spin you would not know either of them had done anything because both are also coterminal.</p>
