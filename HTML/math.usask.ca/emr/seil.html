            <h4>Logarithms and Modelling</h4>

            <p>
                Many phenomena in nature seem to follow the law that an amount A varies with time according to the formula <center>A=A<sub>0</sub> e<sup>kt</sup> </center> where A<sub>0</sub> is the original amount (the amount at time t=0) and k is a non-zero constant.  
            </p>

            <p>
                If k is positive, then the amount A gets larger or grows with time, and the amount is said to be experiencing <b> exponential growth</b>. <br>
                If k is negative, then the amount A gets smaller or diminishes with time, and the amount is said to be experiencing <b> exponential decay</b>.
            </p>

            <p>
                When solving exponential growth/decay problems, two situations often occur:
            </p>
                
            <ul>
                <li> <p>Time is given; you are to find the amount at that given time.  This usually just involves evaluating the amount function.</p>

                <li> <p>The amount is given; you are to determine at what time does this amount occur.  This usually involves solving an exponential equation, which means logarithms will be needed.</p>
            </ul>

            <p>
                For a straightforward application of these ideas, see the <a href="examples/expgrtheg.html">exponential growth problem</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>
                Of course, word problems involving exponential growth and decay may be set up in different ways.  Sometimes you will have to determine A<sub>0</sub> or k or both, from the information given in the problem, before you proceed as indicated above. See the <a href="examples/expdeceg.html">radioactive decay example.</a>
