# Mathwiz – Educational Math Website

## Overview
Mathwiz is an educational site designed to help learners understand and practice various mathematical concepts from **Pre‑Calculus** and **General Mathematics.**

The site contains:
- Topic introductions and explanations
- Worked examples
- References to further reading
- A retro‑inspired visual design with a custom logo and themed background

This repository contains the **fully revised HTML5/CSS version** of the original 2019 Mathwiz project. The revision preserves the original look, layout, and interactive features while cleaning the code:

- Removed all inline styles and invalid HTML
- Centralized all styling in `styles.css`
- Preserved original spacing, fonts, and images
- Improved consistency and maintainability

This site also contains faithfully reconstructed archived educational pages from the University of Saskatchewan, preserved to ensure the original information remains accessible.
